Python - Hello World

This is my first Python project.
I used it to get comfortable with basic Python commands and simple scripts.

I learned how to:
 • run Python files,
 • print text with print(),
 • work with basic strings,
 • and write scripts that follow the required format.

All files in this project use #!/usr/bin/python3 and must be executable.
