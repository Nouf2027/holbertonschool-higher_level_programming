This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
You learn how to use classes as blueprints and objects (instances) as real examples created from those classes.

You understand how attributes store data, methods define behavior, and how self refers to the current object.
The project also explains how objects are initialized using init, how Python handles public, protected, and private attributes, and how to control access using properties.

You learn how Python stores attributes in dict, how it searches for attributes, and how to access them dynamically using getattr().

Overall, the goal is to help you think in OOP, understand how Python objects work internally, and write clean, organized, and maintainable code without relying on Google.
