# Python – if/else, loops and functions

This folder contains my practice tasks for Python basics using
conditions, loops and simple functions.  
Each file is a small script where I tested how to:
- check if a number is positive, zero or negative
- work with if, elif, else
- use for loops and ranges
- write simple Python functions

These exercises helped me understand the flow of programs
and how Python decides what code to run.
