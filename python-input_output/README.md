# Python - Input/Output
## Description
This project focuses on Python file input/output operations, JSON serialization and deserialization, and data persistence techniques. It covers reading from and writing to files, converting Python objects to and from JSON format, and implementing safe and structured data storage mechanisms.## Files

| `1-write_file.py` | Writes a string to a text file |
| `2-append_write.py` | Appends a string to the end of a text file |
| `3-to_json_string.py` | Converts a Python object to a JSON string |
| `4-from_json_string.py` | Converts a JSON string to a Python object |
| `5-save_to_json_file.py` | Saves a Python object to a JSON file |
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | Loads a Python object from a JSON file |
| `7-add_item.py` | Adds command-line arguments to a list and saves them in a JSON file |
| `8-class_to_json.py` | Converts a class instance to a dictionary for JSON serialization |
| `9-student.py` | Defines a Student class with basic JSON serialization |
| `10-student.py` | Student class with filtered JSON serialization |
| `11-student.py` | Student class with reload functionality from JSON |
| `12-pascal_triangle.py` | Generates Pascal’s Triangle |
