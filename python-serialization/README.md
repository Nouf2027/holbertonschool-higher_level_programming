## Description

This project focuses on Python serialization and marshaling techniques, which are essential for efficient data storage and transmission.  
It demonstrates how to convert Python objects into different serialized formats and restore them back when needed.

Throughout this project, we work with multiple serialization formats such as **JSON**, **Pickle**, **CSV**, and **XML**, and apply them in practical scenarios including file persistence and basic client-server communication.
